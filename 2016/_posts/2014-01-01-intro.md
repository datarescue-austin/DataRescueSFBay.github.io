# DataRescue SF Bay

## Feb 11 2017 at UC Berkeley

**\#DataRescueSFBay** is an opportunity for programmers, scientists, archivists, activists, and volunteers of all kinds to identify, back-up, and help preserve publicly accessible federal data resources in the public interest, in the event they are removed from public view and use. 

Join us for a day of civic technology and citizen archiving, at a time when scientific research in the public interest is increasingly at risk.

Note that registration is now closed for the Feb 11th event ([Brochure](http://datarescuesfbay.org/img/DataRescueSFBay.pdf)), as we are at capacity. We are so thrilled to see so much interest in this event and are looking at planning future events in the Bay Area soon. Please follow us on social media or subscribe to our mailing list (below) for more info.
