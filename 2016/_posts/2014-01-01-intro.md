# DataRescue Austin

## March 3, 2017 | UT Austin iSchool


**\#DataRescueATX** at UT is an opportunity for programmers, scientists, archivists, activists, and volunteers of all kinds to identify, back-up, and help preserve publicly accessible federal data resources in the public interest, in the event they are removed from public view and use. 

Join us for a day of civic technology and citizen archiving, at a time when scientific research in the public interest is increasingly at risk. Weâ€™re looking for people who are knowledgable about environmental research and data, including data scientists, hackers, archivists, librarians, writers, web designers, people with good communication skills, and anyone else who is eager to help!

Please follow us on social media, sign up for the event <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/datarescue-austin-at-ut-tickets-32341815240"> here</a>, or email <a href="datarescueaustin@gmail.com">datarescueaustin@gmail.com</a> for more info.
