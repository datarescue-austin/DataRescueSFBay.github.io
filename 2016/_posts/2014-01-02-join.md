# What you’ll be doing
 
Data Rescue participants can choose from among several different “tracks” depending on their interests and skills.

- [**Seeding and Sorting**](https://datarefuge.github.io/workflow/seeding/) (to feed the End of Term Archive) // [**Surveying**](https://datarefuge.github.io/workflow/surveying/#what-do-surveyors-do): This is the widest path and requires a variety of skill levels. Surveyors identify key programs, datasets, and documents on Federal Agency websites that are vulnerable to change and loss. Using templates and how-to guides, they create Main Agency Primers in order to introduce a particular agency, and Sub-Agency Primers in order to guide web archiving efforts by laying out a list of URLs that cover the breadth of an agency.

- [**Researchers**](https://datarefuge.github.io/workflow/researching/) review URLs the Seeders & Sorters mark as “uncrawlable” to confirm that seeders' assessments were correct (that is, that the URL/dataset is indeed uncrawlable), and investigate how the dataset could be best harvested. **Consider this path if you have a strong front end web experience or experience with web-based research.**

- [**Harvesters**](https://datarefuge.github.io/workflow/harvesting/) take the uncrawlable data and try to figure out how to actually capture it based on the recommendations of the Researchers. This is a complex task which can require substantial technical expertise, and which requires different techniques for different tasks. **Consider this path if you have programming skills.**

- [**Documenters & Storytellers**](http://www.ppehlab.org/storytelling) help record and publicize stories about the importance of climate and environmental data on our everyday lives and share the work on social media. Consider this path if you have skills in writing and social media.
