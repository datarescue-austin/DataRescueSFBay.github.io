# Join a DataRescue Team

If you would like to attend DataRescue Austin please fill out this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/UMUxNsth1YwOUBJQ2">form</a> after reading the information below about the types of team members that we need. Team guides will lead you through the following paths: please, choose one according to your interests and skills. If you have skills in one of these areas and want to serve as a guide or if you would like to work as a volunteer, please email us <a href="datarescue@gmail.com">datarescue@gmail.com</a>. If you’d rather remain decide what path to join on the day of the event, please be sure to register for the event <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/datarescue-austin-at-ut-tickets-32341815240">here</a>, that’ll help us know how much food to get. Please familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://datarefuge.github.io/workflow/">technical workflow</a> and recommended skills for the each path. Volunteers and team guides will be available to help troubleshoot throughout the day, but technical training for participants will not be a significant feature of this event.

DataRescue Austin @ UT will focus on the following <a href="http://www.ppehlab.org/datarescueworkflow">four data rescue paths</a>:

<a href="https://datarefuge.github.io/workflow/seeding/">Seeding and Sorting</a> (to feed the End of Term Archive): This is the widest path and requires a variety of skill levels. Seeders and Sorters canvass the resources of a given government agency, identifying important URLs. They identify whether those URLs can be crawled by the Internet Archive's webcrawler.

<a href="https://datarefuge.github.io/workflow/researching/">Researchers</a> review URLs the Seeders & Sorters mark as “uncrawlable” to confirm that seeders' assessments were correct (that is, that the URL/dataset is indeed uncrawlable), and investigate how the dataset could be best harvested. Consider this path if you have a strong front end web experience and like to find out more information about things.

<a href="https://datarefuge.github.io/workflow/harvesting/">Harvesters</a> take the uncrawlable data and try to figure out how to actually capture it based on the recommendations of the Researchers. This is a complex task which can require substantial technical expertise, and which requires different techniques for different tasks. Consider this path if you have hacking and tech skills.

<a href="http://www.ppehlab.org/storytelling">Documenters & Storytellers</a> help record and publicize stories about the importance of climate and environmental data on our everyday lives and share the work on social media. Consider this path if you have skills in writing and social media, arts, blogging, photography, journalism, and media. We invite you to write field notes or story about who and which local communities, organizations, and institutions currently use specific datasets, and how.
