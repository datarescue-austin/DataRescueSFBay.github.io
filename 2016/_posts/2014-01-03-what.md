# Who we are

We believe that federal data belongs to everyone. Scientific and environmental data collected and published by the federal government through agencies like NASA, NOAA, the EPA and others is vital to public health and safety. Similarly, the federal government’s social and economic data is vital to our ability to craft and hone effective public policy, and to hold public officials accountable. Threats to dismantle the federal government’s data collection and scientific research infrastructure—from databases to satellites to models for climate, air and water—are also threats to our health, our rights, and our democracy.  

DataRescue Austin is a nonpartisan alliance of local programmers, scientists, and writers dedicated to maintaining public access to federal data. We are part of the nationwide [#DataRefuge](https://www.ppehlab.org/datarefuge/) project, in collaboration with the [Environmental Data and Governance Initiative](https://envirodatagov.org/) and the Internet Archives’ [End of Term Project](http://eotarchive.cdlib.org/2016.html).  Our goal is raise awareness of the crucial role federal agencies play in data collection and storage, the value of that data to our communities, and its vulnerability to changing governmental priorities.
