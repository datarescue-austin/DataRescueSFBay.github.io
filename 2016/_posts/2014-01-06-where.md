# Where

The main location is the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, inside Doe Memorial Library on UC Berkeley campus. We will also be using some classrooms next door in South Hall at the UC-Berkeley School of Information.

It is easiest to enter through the north entrance of Doe, on Memorial Glade. BIDS will be immediately to your left, in room 190. If you need step-free access, please enter on the south side of Doe, behind Wheeler Hall and South Hall. A map can be found [here](http://datarescuesfbay.org/img/doe-ischool-map.png).
