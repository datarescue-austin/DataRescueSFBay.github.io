# DataRescue Austin

## March 3, 2017 at UT Austin

**\#DataRescueATX** is an opportunity for programmers, scientists, archivists, activists, and volunteers of all kinds to identify, back-up, and help preserve publicly accessible federal data resources in the public interest, in the event they are removed from public view and use. 

Join us for a day of civic technology and citizen archiving, at a time when scientific research in the public interest is increasingly at risk.

Please follow us on social media or subscribe to our mailing list (below) for more info.
